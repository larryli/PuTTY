This is the README for the source archive of PuTTY, a free Win32
and Unix Telnet and SSH client.

If you want to rebuild PuTTY from source, we provide a variety of
Makefiles and equivalents. (If you have fetched the source from
Subversion, you'll have to generate the Makefiles yourself -- see
below.)

For building on Windows:

 - windows/Makefile.vc is for command-line builds on MS Visual C++
   systems. Change into the `windows' subdirectory and type `nmake
   -f Makefile.vc' to build all the PuTTY binaries.

   (We've also had one report of success building with the
   OpenWatcom compiler -- www.openwatcom.org -- using Makefile.vc
   with `wmake -ms -f makefile.vc' and NO_MULTIMON, although we
   haven't tried this ourselves.)

 - Inside the windows/MSVC subdirectory are MS Visual Studio project
   files for doing GUI-based builds of the various PuTTY utilities.
   These have been tested on Visual Studio 6.

   You should be able to build each PuTTY utility by loading the
   corresponding .dsp file in Visual Studio. For example,
   MSVC/putty/putty.dsp builds PuTTY itself, MSVC/plink/plink.dsp
   builds Plink, and so on.

 - windows/Makefile.bor is for the Borland C compiler. Type `make -f
   Makefile.bor' while in the `windows' subdirectory to build all
   the PuTTY binaries.

 - windows/Makefile.cyg is for Cygwin / mingw32 installations. Type
   `make -f Makefile.cyg' while in the `windows' subdirectory to
   build all the PuTTY binaries. Note that by default the multiple
   monitor support is excluded from the Cygwin build, since at the
   time of writing Cygwin doesn't include the necessary headers.

 - windows/Makefile.lcc is for lcc-win32. Type `make -f
   Makefile.lcc' while in the `windows' subdirectory. (You will
   probably need to specify COMPAT=-DNO_MULTIMON.)

For building on Unix:

 - unix/configure is for Unix and GTK. If you don't have GTK, you
   should still be able to build the command-line utilities (PSCP,
   PSFTP, Plink, PuTTYgen) using this script. To use it, change
   into the `unix' subdirectory, run `./configure' and then `make'.
 
 - unix/Makefile.gtk is for non-autoconfigured builds. This makefile
   expects you to change into the `unix' subdirectory, then run `make
   -f Makefile.gtk'. Note that Unix PuTTY has mostly only been tested
   on Linux so far; portability problems such as BSD-style ptys or
   different header file requirements are expected.

   For the graphical utilities, Gtk+-1.2 is required. Gtk+-2.0 is not
   yet supported.

   There is an `install' target; note that by default it tries to
   install `man' pages, which need to be built using Halibut first --
   see below.

All of the Makefiles are generated automatically from the file
`Recipe' by the Perl script `mkfiles.pl'. Additions and corrections
to Recipe and the mkfiles.pl are much more useful than additions and
corrections to the alternative Makefiles themselves.

Documentation (in various formats including Windows Help and Unix
`man' pages) is to be built from the Halibut (`.but') files in the
`doc' subdirectory using `doc/Makefile'. Halibut can be found at
<http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/halibut/>.

If you want to send bug reports or feature requests, please read the
Feedback section of the web site before doing so. Sending one-line
reports saying `it doesn't work' will waste your time as much as
ours.
