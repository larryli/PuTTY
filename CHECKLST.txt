Checklists for PuTTY administrative procedures
==============================================

Locations of the licence
------------------------

The PuTTY copyright notice and licence are stored in quite a few
places. At the start of a new year, the copyright year needs
updating in all of them; and when someone sends a massive patch,
their name needs adding in all of them too.

The LICENCE file in the main source distribution:

 - putty/LICENCE

The resource files:

 - putty/windows/pageant.rc
    + the copyright date appears twice, once in the About box and
      once in the Licence box. Don't forget to change both!
 - putty/windows/puttygen.rc
    + the copyright date appears twice, once in the About box and
      once in the Licence box. Don't forget to change both!
 - putty/windows/win_res.rc2
    + the copyright date appears twice, once in the About box and
      once in the Licence box. Don't forget to change both!
 - putty/windows/version.rc2
    + the copyright date appears once only.
 - putty/unix/gtkdlg.c
    + the copyright date appears twice, once in the About box and
      once in the Licence box. Don't forget to change both!

The documentation (both the preamble blurb and the licence appendix):

 - putty/doc/blurb.but
 - putty/doc/licence.but

The website:

Preparing to make a release
---------------------------

Now that PuTTY is in git, a lot of the release preparation can be done
in advance, in local checkouts, and not pushed until the actual
process of _releasing_ it.

To begin with, before dropping the tag, make sure everything is ready
for it:

 - First of all, go through the source (including the documentation),
   and the website, and review anything tagged with a comment
   containing the word XXX-REVIEW-BEFORE-RELEASE.
   (Any such comments should state clearly what needs to be done.)

 - Also, do some testing of the Windows version with Minefield, and
   of the Unix version with valgrind or efence or both. In
   particular, any headline features for the release should get a
   workout with memory checking enabled!

 - Double-check that we have removed anything tagged with a comment
   containing the words XXX-REMOVE-BEFORE-RELEASE or
   XXX-REVIEW-BEFORE-RELEASE. ('git grep XXX-RE' should only show up
   hits in this file itself.)

 - Now update version numbers in
    * putty/LATEST.VER
    * putty/windows/putty.iss (four times, on consecutive lines)
    * putty/doc/pscp.but (and make sure the rest of the transcript is
      up to date)
    * putty/doc/plink.but (likewise)

 - Reset the epoch used for the $(Days) value computed in Buildscr for
   the Windows binary version resource. It's probably not a good idea
   to set it to _today_ (since it might clash with the zero-valued
   field used in actual releases), so perhaps we should start it 1000
   days before the release date so as to have a largish number
   recognisable as being the right kind of thing by its order of
   magnitude. So, do this:

     perl -e 'printf "%d\n", time/86400 - 1000'

   and then substitute the resulting value into the definition of
   'Epoch' in Buildscr.

 - Commit those version number and epoch changes (on the appropriate
   branch, of course!), and then make the release tag pointing at the
   resulting commit.

 - If the release is on a branch (which I expect it generally will
   be), merge that branch to master.

 - Write a release announcement (basically a summary of the changes
   since the last release). Squirrel it away in
   atreus:src/putty-local/announce-<ver> in case it's needed again
   within days of the release going out.

 - Update the web site, in a local checkout.
   + Adjust front page to say 'The latest version is <ver>'.
   + Adjust front page to add a news item.
   + Adjust Download page to say 'The latest release version (<ver>)'.
   + Adjust Download page to update filenames of installer and Unix
     tarball (both in the hrefs themselves and the link text).
   + Check over the Download page and remove any mention of
     pre-releases, if there were any before this release. Comment out
     the big pre-release section at the top, and also adjust the
     sections about source archives at the bottom.
   + Do the same on the Docs page.
   + Adjust header text on Changelog page. (That includes changing
     `are new' in previous version to `were new'!)
   + .htaccess has an individual redirect for each version number. Add
     a new one.

 - For 0.66 only: if it's not already done, switch the remaining
   signature links on the Download page over to using the new
   signature style. Then remove this checklist item, since it'll only
   need doing this once.

 - If there are any last-minute wishlist entries (e.g. security
   vulnerabilities fixed in the new release), write entries for them
   in a local checkout of putty-wishlist.

 - Update the wishlist mechanism for the new release. This can be done
   without touching individual items by editing the @releases array in
   control/bugs2html.

 - Build the release, by checking out the release tag:
     git checkout 0.XX
     bob . RELEASE=0.XX
   This should generate a basically valid release directory as
   `build.out/putty', and provide link maps and sign.sh alongside that
   in build.out.

 - Double-check in build.log that the release was built from the right
   git commit.

 - Do a bit of checking that the release binaries basically work,
   report their version numbers accurately, and so on. Test the
   installer and the Unix source tarball.

 - Sign the release: in the `build.out' directory, type
     sh sign.sh -r putty
   and enter the passphrases a lot of times.

The actual release procedure
----------------------------

Once all the above preparation is done and the release has been built
locally, this is the procedure for putting it up on the web.

 - Save the link maps. Currently I keep these on atreus, in
   src/putty-local/maps-<version>.

 - Upload the entire release directory to atreus:www/putty/<version>.

 - Do final checks on the release directory in its new location:
    + verify all the signatures:
      for i in `find . -name '*.gpg'`; do case $i in *sums*) gpg --verify $i;; *) gpg --verify $i ${i%%.gpg};; esac; done
    + check the checksum files:
      md5sum -c md5sums
      sha1sum -c sha1sums
      sha256sum -c sha256sums
      sha512sum -c sha512sums

 - Having double-checked the release, copy it from atreus to
   chiark:ftp/putty-<ver> and to the:www/putty/<ver>.

 - Check the permissions! Actually try downloading from the, to make
   sure it really works.

 - Update the HTTP redirect at the:www/putty/htaccess which points the
   virtual subdir `latest' at the actual latest release dir. TEST THIS
   ONE - it's quite important.

 - Update the FTP symlink (chiark:ftp/putty-latest -> putty-<ver>).

 - Check the Docs page links correctly to the release docs. (It
   should do this automatically, owing to the `latest' HTTP
   redirect.)

 - Check that the web server attaches the right content type to .HLP
   and .CNT files.

 - Run 'git push' in the website checkout, and then 'git pull' in
   ~/www/putty on atreus to fetch the website updates.

 - Push the changes to PuTTY itself. Something like:
     git push origin master        # update the master branch
     git push origin --tags        # should push the new release tag
     git push origin :pre-0.XX     # delete the pre-release branch

 - Run 'git push' in the putty-wishlist checkout. Then run 'git pull'
   in ~/pub/putty-wishlist on atreus, and update the wishlist web
   pages with the commands
     cd ~/pub/putty-wishlist/control
     perl bugs2html

 - Check over the web site to make sure all the changes to wishlist
   and main web pages are present and correct.

 - Run webupdate, so that all the changes on atreus propagate to
   chiark. Important to do this _before_ announcing that the release
   is available.

 - After running webupdate, run update-rsync on chiark and verify that
   the rsync mirror package (~/ftp/putty-website-mirror) contains a
   subdirectory for the new version and mentions it in its .htaccess.

 - Announce the release!
    + Construct a release announcement email whose message body is the
      announcement written above, and which includes the following
      headers:
       * Reply-To: <putty@projects.tartarus.org>
       * Subject: PuTTY X.YZ is released
    + Mail that release announcement to
      <putty-announce@lists.tartarus.org>.
    + Post it to comp.security.ssh.
    + Mention it in <TDHTT> on mono.

 - Edit ~/adm/puttysnap.sh to disable pre-release builds, if they were
   previously enabled.

 - Relax (slightly).
