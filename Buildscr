# Start by figuring out what our version information looks like.
#
# There are four classes of PuTTY build:
#  - a release, which just has an X.YY version number
#  - a prerelease, which has an X.YY version number, plus a date and
#    version control commit id (and is considered to be 'almost'
#    version X.YY)
#  - a development snapshot, which just has a date and commit id
#  - a custom build, which also has a date and commit id (but is
#    labelled differently, to stress that development snapshots are
#    built from the checked-in code by the automated nightly script
#    whereas custom builds are made manually, perhaps from uncommitted
#    changes, e.g. to send to a user for diagnostic or testing
#    purposes).
#
# The four classes of build are triggered by invoking bob with
# different command-line variable definitions:
#
#  - RELEASE=X.YY makes a release build
#  - PRERELEASE=X.YY makes a prerelease build (combined with the build
#    date and VCS info)
#  - setting SNAPSHOT to any non-empty string makes a development
#    snapshot
#  - setting none of these makes a custom build.

# If we need a date for our build, start by computing it in the
# various forms we need. $(Ndate) is the date in purely numeric form
# (YYYYMMDD); $(Date) is separated as YYYY-MM-DD; $(Days) is the
# number of days since the epoch.
